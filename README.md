## A Note on the Learning Process

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to develop my programming skills. It started as a simple web page and has evolved into a modern application with a professional development workflow and automated deployment pipeline.

I want to be transparent about the process: I used an AI assistant as a tool to help write and, more importantly, *explain* the code. My goal was to learn how to code *with* AI, using it as a learning partner to grasp fundamentals step-by-step. This project is a result of that learning journey.
