# Simple Note App

A clean, simple, and modern note-taking web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed using a modern, automated workflow. All notes are saved directly in your browser's local storage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important User Information

### Data Security Warning

This application stores notes directly in your browser's `localStorage`. The data is **not encrypted**. For your own security, please do not store sensitive information such as passwords, personal identification numbers, or private keys.

Below is the **updated README** (plain markdown) that adds every new feature you‚Äôve shipped since the last official copy.

Simply **append** the new bullets under the relevant headings.

## ‚ú® New Features & Polish

- **Pastel Hashtag Colors**  
  Every unique `#tag` receives its own gentle pastel color; identical tags keep the same hue across sessions.

- **Purple Search Theme**  
  When the search bar is active, both the input field and the üîç search button switch to a consistent purple accent in light and dark modes.

- **Improved Dark-Mode Legibility**  
  Text inside colored hashtag badges is now black while in dark mode, making tags easier to read.

- **Rapid Search & Highlight**  
  Real-time highlighting of search terms inside notes, plus persistent tag-based filtering from the sort dropdown.

- **Undo / Redo Shortcuts**  
  Use Ctrl + Z / Ctrl + Y (Cmd + Z / Cmd + Shift + Z on macOS) to step backward or forward through note changes.

- **Keyboard Search Toggle**  
  Press Ctrl + F (or Cmd + F) to show / hide the search bar without clicking.

- **Responsive Drag Handle**  
  On mobile, a subtle `‚ãÆ‚ãÆ` indicator appears so users know notes are draggable.

- **Empty-State Message**  
  A friendly ‚ÄúNo notes yet ‚Äì start typing!‚Äù prompt shows when the list is blank.

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tech Details

- **Security**: All note content is sanitized with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) before rendering to prevent XSS.  
- **Performance**: Input debouncing and virtualized re-rendering keep the UI snappy with large note sets.  
- **Accessibility**: Emoji buttons now have `aria-label`s and all interactive elements are keyboard-reachable.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Tech Stack)

This project uses fundamental web technologies, enhanced by a modern build process for performance and reliability.

-   **HTML:** Structures the content of the application.
-   **CSS:** Handles all styling, including the layout, themes, and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers all the interactive logic for note management, including drag-and-drop functionality.
-   **Vite:** Acts as a lightning-fast development server and bundles the code for production, automatically handling optimizations and cache-busting.
-   **GitHub Actions:** Provides a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

## A Note on the Learning Process

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to develop my programming skills. It started as a simple web page and has evolved into a modern application with a professional development workflow and automated deployment pipeline.

I want to be transparent about the process: I used an AI assistant as a tool to help write and, more importantly, *explain* the code. My goal was to learn how to code *with* AI, using it as a learning partner to grasp fundamentals step-by-step. This project is a result of that learning journey.
