## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Tech Stack)

This project uses fundamental web technologies, enhanced by a modern build process for performance and reliability.

-   **HTML:** Structures the content and layout of the application.
-   **CSS:** Handles all styling, including the layout, light/dark themes, responsive design, and all animations.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers all the interactive logic, from note management and local storage persistence to the undo/redo history and drag-and-drop functionality.
-   **Vite:** Acts as a lightning-fast development server and bundles the code for production, automatically handling optimizations.
-   **GitHub Actions:** Provides a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

## A Note on the Learning Process

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to develop my programming skills. It started as a simple web page and has evolved into a modern application with a professional development workflow and automated deployment pipeline.

I want to be transparent about the process: I used an AI assistant as a tool to help write and, more importantly, *explain* the code. My goal was to learn how to code *with* AI, using it as a learning partner to grasp fundamentals step-by-step. This project is a result of that learning journey.
