This project uses fundamental web technologies, enhanced by a modern build process for performance and reliability.

-   **HTML:** Structures the content of the application.
-   **CSS:** Handles all styling, including the layout, themes, and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers all the interactive logic for note management.
-   **Vite:** Acts as a lightning-fast development server and bundles the code for production, automatically handling optimizations and cache-busting.

## A Note on the Learning Process

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to develop my programming skills. It started as a simple web page and has evolved into a modern application with a professional development workflow and automated deployment pipeline.

I want to be transparent about the process: I used an AI assistant as a tool to help write and, more importantly, *explain* the code. My goal was to learn how to code *with* AI, using it as a learning partner to grasp fundamentals step-by-step. This project is a result of that learning journey.
